# WovenNews
Simple Newsfeed Android application that retrieves articles from HackerNews (https://news.ycombinator.com/)  and allows users to sort and open these articles in their browser. Loads up to 500 of the most recent stories or best stories provided from the public API asynchronously.  Users can switch between viewing most recent or highest rated articles using 2 buttons near the top of the screen.  

# Project Setup
Load the project into Android Studio and build using Gradle (https://gradle.org/).

# Build Information
This project was built with Gradle 7.0.2 & Android Gradle Plugin Version 7.0.3.  The minimum SDK is 21, while the target SDK is 30.  The minimum API is API 21: Android 5.0 (Lollipop).  It was primarily tested on API 24: Android 7.0 (Nougat) on an emulated Google Pixel 2 through Android Studio.
